This repository contains my project for the course DD2358: Introduction to High-Performance Computing (7.5 credits), which I attended as part of my exchange semester. The course provided an in-depth introduction to high-performance computing methods, including profiling, code optimization, and parallel computing techniques. Through this project, I applied the concepts and techniques learned during the lecture to develop an efficient solution for computationally intensive tasks.
